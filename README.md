LR and RF with optimal parameters<br />
In this assignment, our goal is to optimize the Multilayer Perceptron Model (MLP model) for both the given dataset and the application on unseen datasets. After building the MLP model, we will compare the AIC scores across different models to evaluate their performance. In addition, we will consider the absolute value of KL-Divergence and AIC score when selecting the best parameter for our model. Since AIC estimates the relative amount of information lost by a given model, we will minimize the AIC for our final model while minimizing the absolute value of KL-Divergence.
